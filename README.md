# Design Patterns Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of design patterns for JavaScript and React, providing both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

## Contents

### JavaScript Design Patterns

Explore fundamental creational, structural, and behavioral patterns in pure JavaScript:

- **[Detailed Guide](Design-Patterns/index.md)**: In-depth explanations with real-world problems, code snippets, pros/cons, and when to use each pattern.
- **[Practical Guide](Design-Patterns/index2.md)**: Quick-reference guide with concise examples and implementation tips for 20+ patterns.

### React Design Patterns

Learn React-specific patterns for building scalable, maintainable UI components:

- **[Compound Component Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Compound-ComponentPtrn/readme.md)**: Allowing multiple related components to work together implicitly via shared parent state.
- **[Container–Presenter Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Container–PresenterPtrn/readme.md)**: Separating data logic from presentation logic.
- **[Controlled-Uncontrolled Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Controlled-UncontrolledPtrn/readme.md)**: Managing form state in React components.
- **[Custom Hook Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Custom-hook/readme.md)**: Extracting and reusing stateful logic with custom hooks.
- **[Facade Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/FacadePtrn/readme.md)**: Providing a simplified interface to complex subsystems.
- **[Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/HOCPtrn/readme.md)**: Reusing component logic through wrapper functions.
- **[Optimistic Hook Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/OptimisticHookPtrn/readme.md)**: Updating UI immediately while handling async operations.
- **[Performance Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/PerformancePtrn/readme.md)**: Optimizing React app performance.
- **[Provider Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/ProviderPtrn/readme.md)**: Sharing state across component tree with Context API.
- **[Publish-Subscribe Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Pub-SubPtrn/readme.md)**: Decoupling event producers from consumers.
- **[Render Props Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Render-PropPtrn/readmd.md)**: Sharing code between components using render functions.
- **[Slot Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/SlotPtrn/readme.md)**: Flexible component composition with predefined slots.
- **[State Reducer Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/StateReducerPtrn/readme.md)**: Managing complex state transitions with reducers.
- **[Strategy Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/StrategyPtrn/readme.md)**: Selecting algorithms at runtime.

## Getting Started

Each pattern directory contains detailed explanations, code examples, and use cases. Start with the guides in `Design-Patterns/` for foundational concepts, then explore React-specific implementations in `React-Design-Patterns/`.
