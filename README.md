# Design Patterns Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of design patterns for JavaScript and React, providing both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

## Contents

### JavaScript Design Patterns

Explore fundamental creational, structural, and behavioral patterns in pure JavaScript, organized by pattern with clear examples and use cases:

- **[Module Pattern](Design-Patterns/ModulePtrn/readme.md)**: Encapsulate private data/functions and expose a public API.
- **[Revealing Module Pattern](Design-Patterns/Revealing-ModulePtrn/readme.md)**: Make public/private interfaces explicit.
- **[Singleton Pattern](Design-Patterns/SingletonPtrn/readme.md)**: Ensure only one instance exists with global access.
- **[Factory Pattern](Design-Patterns/FactoryPtrn/readme.md)**: Delegate object instantiation to a separate factory.
- **[Builder Pattern](Design-Patterns/BuilderPtrn/readme.md)**: Construct complex objects step-by-step with a fluent API.
- **[Strategy Pattern](Design-Patterns/StrategyPtrn/readme.md)**: Select algorithms at runtime.
- **[State Pattern](Design-Patterns/StatePtrn/readme.md)**: Change behavior based on internal state.
- **[Observer Pattern](Design-Patterns/ObserverPtrn/readme.md)**: Notify multiple objects about state changes.
- **[Mediator Pattern](Design-Patterns/MediatorPtrn/readme.md)**: Coordinate complex interactions between objects.
- **[Command Pattern](Design-Patterns/CommandPtrn/readme.md)**: Encapsulate requests as objects for undo/redo.
- **[Prototype Pattern](Design-Patterns/PrototypePtrn/readme.md)**: Create objects by cloning existing ones.
- **[Decorator Pattern](Design-Patterns/DecoratorPtrn/readme.md)**: Add behavior dynamically without subclassing.
- **[Adapter Pattern](Design-Patterns/AdapterPtrn/readme.md)**: Convert incompatible interfaces.
- **[Facade Pattern](Design-Patterns/FacadePtrn/readme.md)**: Provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems.
- **[Iterator Pattern](Design-Patterns/IteratorPtrn/readme.md)**: Traverse collections without exposing internals.
- **[Proxy Pattern](Design-Patterns/ProxyPtrn/readme.md)**: Control access to objects.
- **[Chain of Responsibility Pattern](Design-Patterns/Chain-ResponsibilityPtrn/readme.md)**: Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
- **[Flyweight Pattern](Design-Patterns/FlyweightPtrn/readme.md)**: Share state between similar objects to save memory.
- **[Template Method Pattern](Design-Patterns/Template-MethodPtrn/readme.md)**: Define algorithm skeleton with customizable steps.

### React Design Patterns

Learn React-specific patterns for building scalable, maintainable UI components:

- **[Compound Component Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Compound-ComponentPtrn/readme.md)**: Allowing multiple related components to work together implicitly via shared parent state.
- **[Container–Presenter Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Container–PresenterPtrn/readme.md)**: Separating data logic from presentation logic.
- **[Controlled-Uncontrolled Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Controlled-UncontrolledPtrn/readme.md)**: Managing form state in React components.
- **[Custom Hook Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Custom-hook/readme.md)**: Extracting and reusing stateful logic with custom hooks.
- **[Facade Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/FacadePtrn/readme.md)**: Providing a simplified interface to complex subsystems.
- **[Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/HOCPtrn/readme.md)**: Reusing component logic through wrapper functions.
- **[Optimistic Hook Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/OptimisticHookPtrn/readme.md)**: Updating UI immediately while handling async operations.
- **[Performance Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/PerformancePtrn/readme.md)**: Optimizing React app performance.
- **[Provider Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/ProviderPtrn/readme.md)**: Sharing state across component tree with Context API.
- **[Publish-Subscribe Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Pub-SubPtrn/readme.md)**: Decoupling event producers from consumers.
- **[Render Props Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/Render-PropPtrn/readme.md)**: Sharing code between components using render functions.
- **[Slot Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/SlotPtrn/readme.md)**: Flexible component composition with predefined slots.
- **[State Reducer Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/StateReducerPtrn/readme.md)**: Managing complex state transitions with reducers.
- **[Strategy Pattern](React-Design-Patterns/StrategyPtrn/readme.md)**: Selecting algorithms at runtime.

## Getting Started

Each pattern directory contains detailed explanations, code examples, and use cases. Start with the guides in `Design-Patterns/` for foundational concepts, then explore React-specific implementations in `React-Design-Patterns/`.

## Contributing

This repository welcomes contributions! If you have improvements, additional examples, or new patterns to add, please submit a pull request or raise [issue](https://github.com/kumaratul60/design-patterns/issues/new).
